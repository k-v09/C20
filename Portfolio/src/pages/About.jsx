    <p>
      I started programming in my freshman year of high school and for the rest of 
      my time at school, I used this skill to aid my personal projects. I learned languages such 
      as: python, c#, java, and go; useful tools including: Unity, NumPy, and Flutter; and 
      studied in the fields of computer science, networking & telecommunications, and robotics. 
      These skills all helped me to learn not only the knowledge to understand code, but also the 
      mindset that it requires.
