    <p>
      I’ve always had a fascination with how things work—whether it’s the structure of music, 
      the elegance of math, or the mechanics of code. My journey into programming began in my freshman 
      year of high school, but it was more than just a subject to study; it became a tool for exploring 
      my wider interests. Over the years, I’ve dived deep into languages, tools, and technologies each one 
      expanded the way I could bring my ideas to life, whether in personal projects or creative experiments.
      Beyond programming, I’ve always been captivated by math and physics. These fields have not only sharpened 
      my logical thinking but also deepened my understanding of the world’s underlying structures. From 
      advanced calculus to exploring complex systems in physics, I’ve found that the abstract nature of 
      math and the tangible principles of physics complement my work in robotics and music technology.
      Studying in areas like computer science, networking & telecommunications, and robotics has taught 
      me more than just the technical side of things—it’s given me a mindset of curiosity, problem-solving, 
      and persistence. Whether I’m building modular synthesizers, creating software synths, or tackling a 
      challenging problem in code, I approach each project with the same passion for discovery that first 
      drew me to these subjects.
